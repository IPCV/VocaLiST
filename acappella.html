title: Acappella
subtitle: A dataset for audio-visual singing voice separation
---
<p class="lead mb-0" align="justify">
    <i>Acappella</i> comprises of around <b>46 hours </b>
    of <i>a cappella</i> solo singing videos sourced from YouTube,
    sampled across different singers and languages.
    These YouTube videos were all publicly available at the time of the dataset creation.
    The idea behind <i>Acappella</i> is to provide a large-scale dataset
    to train audio-visual models for singing voice separation.
    Each video recording has been manually selected to exclude parts
    of the videos that do not satisfy any of the following characteristics:
    single frontal face view without occlusions, minimal background
    noise, no beatboxing, no snapping fingers, songs with lyrics
    (e.g. we avoid humming and yodelling).
    The dataset comprises of <b>1493</b> different video samples in total spanning four language categories:
    <b>English</b>, <b>Spanish</b>, <b>Hindi</b> and <b>Others</b>.
    <br></br>
    As a part of the dataset, we also provide the splits for the training
    set, validation set and test set. The <b>training set</b> makes up around
    <b>80%</b> of the total dataset. Around <b>7%</b> of the dataset forms the
    <b>validation set</b> which is used during the training to save the best
    checkpoint. The <b>test set</b> is divided into the following subsets:
    <b>seen-heard</b> and <b>unseen-unheard</b>. The <b>seen-heard test</b> subset consists of samples from known
    singers, i.e. singers seen in the training set.
    The <b>unseen-unheard test</b> subset contains singers who are not a part of the training set.
    The unseen-unheard test subset also contains samples from languages not seen
    in the training set. It presents an approximately
    uniform distribution of samples across language categories and
    gender. The dataset statistics are shown in the figures below.

    Note that the <i>Acappella</i> dataset is unbalanced in terms of the duration as it contains more
female samples than the male ones. This unbalance is present in the training set, validation
set and the seen-heard test subset. However, the unseen-unheard test subset is balanced with
respect to the gender as well as the language categories. The languages included in the ‘others’
language category in the training set are: Italian, Portuguese, Indonesian, Kannada, Arabic,
and Turkish. The samples from ‘others’ language category belonging to the unseen-unheard
test subset are totally new in the sense that these languages were not included in the training
set, those are: Greek, Persian, Assamese, Tamil, Malayalam, Ukrainian, and Croatian.

<h1>How to use?</h1>
<p class="lead mb-0" align="justify">
    To use the dataset, we recommend the users to install the pip package
    acappella_info that contains
    all the necessary info related to the dataset. Alternatively,
    we also provide the files below for the convenience of viewing.

    The IDs of all the YouTube videos that belong to
    the <i>Acappella</i> dataset are made available.
    Each row in the above csv files corresponds to a sample in the dataset.
    As one can see in the splits.json file, a sample is identified in the
    format: <i>ID_start_timestamp_to_end_timestamp</i>. Each sample is a trimmed segment of
    a full-length video obtained by
    trimming that full-length video along the start timestamp and end timestamp.
    This way we exclude parts of the
    full-length videos that
    are not particularly useful to our task for our experiment setup
    (<i>e.g.</i> concealed lips, background noise).
    The start and end timestamps are provided for each of the video IDs (see the csv files).
    We also provide information regarding the language of the song,
    the gender of the singer and the duration of each sample.
    The pip package provides <i>get</i> methods to access all this information.

<h1>Traces</h1>
<p class="lead mb-0" align="justify">
    For this specific paper, we considered certain 4 second segments from
    the samples for validation and evaluation on the test sets rather than evaluating on the
    full-length samples (note that a sample is a trimmed excerpt obtained from a full-length video).
    The 4 second segments were obtained randomly, but frozen across different models for the sake of
    fair comparison of their performances.
    <!--Hence, here we provide the traces corresponding to these 4 second
    segments that we used for validation and evaluation on the test sets. In each of these traces,
    the entries corresponding to the <i>Acappella</i> dataset are listed under the key "acappella_visual".
